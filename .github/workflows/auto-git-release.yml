      # Update major tag and latest
      # Upon AUTOMATIC release, automatically update the MAJOR tag to make it point to the latest version of any minor/patch release, for easy use by the consumers.
      # Also updates the "latest" tag automatically (auto-created), which is meant to be used for development/testing only, not for production.
      # This way, consumers can use @v1 and the @v1 is a tag that is automatically updated when you release a new v1 minor/patch version.
      # Note that if you release a "pre-release", it won't automatically update the "latest" tag, nor the MAJOR tag.
